# GU Mobile App Development Club

The goal of the Mobile App Development Club is to design and build mobile applications that will benefit the students of Gonzaga University and beyond. Members will learn the fundamentals and paradigms of mobile app development.

Members will need no previous knowledge of app development, only a willingness to learn about this exciting field. We will be working with a variety of platforms and organize a variety of projects for students to learn more about this field and put that knowledge into action.

# Learning git

Git is a super important part of the way we do things. If you join the club, you should learn git! We know it can be difficult, so we've setup [a tutorial here](https://gumad.club/lets-learn-git) to help you out!

# How is this site hosted?

This site uses github pages. You can learn more by clicking on "settings" and then scrolling down to "GitHub Pages".

# How do I release new updates?

Just change the html code and then merge into master. Github takes care of everything else.

# What about the domain name?

It's currently on Hover. [Evan](https://github.com/gu-app-club/contacts#evan-conrad) or Max probably has it if you need access.
